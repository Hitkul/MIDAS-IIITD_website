# Abstract 

Mining social media messages for health and
drug related information has received significant
interest in pharmacovigilance research.
Social media sites (e.g., Twitter), have been
used for monitoring drug abuse, adverse reactions
of drug usage and analyzing expression
of sentiments related to drugs. Most of these
studies are based on aggregated results from
a large population rather than specific sets of
individuals. In order to conduct studies at an
individual level or specific cohorts, identifying
posts mentioning intake of medicine by
the user is necessary. Towards this objective,
we train different deep neural network classification
models on a publicly available annotated
dataset and study their performances
on identifying mentions of personal intake of
medicine in tweets. We also design and train
a new architecture of a stacked ensemble of
shallow convolutional neural network (CNN)
ensembles. We use random search for tuning
the hyperparameters of the models and share
the details of the values taken by the hyperparameters
for the best learnt model in different
deep neural network architectures. Our system
produces state-of-the-art results, with a microaveraged
F-score of 0.693.
