# Abstract 

There has been upsurge in the number of people participating in challenges made popular through
social media channels. One of the examples of such a challenge is the Kiki
Challenge, in which people step out of their moving cars and
dance to the tunes of the song, “Kiki, Do you love me?”.
Such an action makes the people taking the challenge prone
to accidents and can also create nuisance for the others traveling on the road. In this work, we introduce the prevalence of such challenges in social media and show how the
machine learning community can aid in preventing dangerous situations triggered by them by developing models that
can distinguish between dangerous and non-dangerous chllenge videos. Towards this objective, we release a new dataset
namely MIDAS-KIKI dataset, consisting of manually annotated dangerous and non-dangerous Kiki challenge videos.
Further, we train a deep learning model to identify dangerous and non-dangerous videos, and report our results.
