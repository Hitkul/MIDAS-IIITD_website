I have Completed my M.tech from IIIT Bhubaneswar, in the field of Natural Language Processing, machine learning, and deep learning. At present, I am working as a research intern at IIIT Delhi in the field of speech identification using deep learning. I am enthusiastic about learning new things and applying it in real world problems.
