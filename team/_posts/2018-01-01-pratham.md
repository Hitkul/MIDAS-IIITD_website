I'm a pre-final year student at NSIT. I'm passionate about social network analysis and data science for social good.Being a avid reader,  I like to read fiction, biographies and motivational novels.   I am always open for a talk and travel. I'm also invested in learning about natural language processing and generative adversarial networks.
