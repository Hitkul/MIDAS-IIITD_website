An Algorithmist, A Researcher @MIDAS, a Computer Engineer @NSIT
Interested in Business and Tech side of things

Hey there, this is Yaman. 
I graduated from NSIT (University of Delhi, India) in 2018 and since then have joined Adobe Systems as a Software Development Engineer (MTS). 

My research interests include NLP and Multimodal Multimedia Applications and  am actively involved in research projects related to them. I have worked on Automated Short Answer Scoring. Additionally, I did a research project on Lipreading.

In addition to this, I have a great interest in Operating Systems and Networks due to them being behemoth systems while simultaneously being able to work flawlessly and coherently. For this, I did an internship at Arista Networks where I was responsible for implementing BFD Protocol on Aristaâ€™s OS (EOS).

I would love if someone with similar or even disparate research interests would like to collaborate with me and MIDAS.
