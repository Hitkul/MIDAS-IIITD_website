In the twenty-first century, the robot will take the place which slave labor occupied in ancient civilization - Nikola Tesla

I am a Graduate Student from NSIT. Currently I am working as Research Assistant at IIIT-D on Automatic Speech Recognition project. Prevously I have worked on Computer vision, particularly on a key probelm related to Robotics Vision. My specialized area is Deep Learning.

My long-term goal is to contribute to the Robotics community, particularly how Robots make intelligent decisions without any human intervention i.e. atrue Android, thatâ€™s the deciding factor if humans would be an interplanetary species or NO.
