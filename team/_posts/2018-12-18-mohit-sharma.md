I am a final year Undergraduate student in Computer Science. I am interested in Theoretical Machine Learning and working with hybrid algorithms which combine existing and Deep Learning approaches. I aim to familiarize myself with all the major application areas, namely NLP, Vision, Representation and Planning. Other than this, I love playing sports.
