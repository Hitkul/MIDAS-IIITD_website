I am a third year software engineering B.Tech student studying in Delhi Technological University. I am a data science enthusiast . I'm constantly looking for resources and ways to learn and become better at it. I am currently interning in IIITD where I am working on a medical dataset and I am using natural language processing for information extraction.
