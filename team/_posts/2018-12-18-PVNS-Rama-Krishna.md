I'm a final year CS undergrad at IIIT Bhubaneswar. My major areas of research include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Augmented Reality. I'm also passionate about developing Websites and Android Apps. I've interned at startups, MNC's and research labs. Apart from this, I'm a District level (Hyderabad) basketball player and an absolute Anime buff.
